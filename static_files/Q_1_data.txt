Republic Day Speech Essay Sample
Respected Principal, Teachers, Guests and dear fellow students,
Good Morning,
As you know, today all of us are here to celebrate the 72nd Republic Day of our country today. Every year, we celebrate Republic day on 26 January because the Constitution of India came to force on this day in 1950.
This day reminds us of our freedom struggle and how the great freedom fighters of our country sacrificed their lives to get us the - Purn Swaraj. It's because of their struggle that today we are living in a democratic country where each citizen has right to - (i) right to equality, (ii) right to freedom, (iii) right against exploitation, (iv) right to freedom of religion, (v) cultural and educational rights, and (vi) right to constitutional remedies.
Today is the day to reaffirm our commitment to unity in diversity, fraternity and equality among all our citizens.
I would like to wind up my speech followed by a moment of silence for the great leaders and freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives so that we can live in a democratic nation.
Thanks again for giving me an opportunity to speak in front of you all.
Jai Hind!
